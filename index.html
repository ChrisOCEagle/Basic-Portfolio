            <p>I am an Eagle Scout that graduated from college with my B.S. degree in Physics. I have several varied interests that includes the following: photography, videogaming, tabletop gaming, math, science, engineering, philosophy, art and general learning.</p>

            <p>These varied interests have kept me always looking towards the horizon as I am definitely a dreamer and my love of learning is my main reason for wanting to learn computer programming. So here I am at Coding Bootcamp looking to get into one of the fastest growing fields out there!</p>
